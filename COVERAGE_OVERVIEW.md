### Low Coverage - Intentionally Mocked (<10%)

These modules are intentionally bypassed in fixtures for deterministic testing:

| Module | Lines | Functions | Reason |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| `merlin-routing/src/router` | 7% (21/300) | 8% (4/50) | MockRouter used |
| `merlin-routing/src/analyzer` | 6.25% (11/176) | 10.53% (2/19) | Mocked for determinism |
| `merlin-cli/src` | 0% (0/12) | 0% (0/6) | CLI entry bypassed |
| `merlin-local/src` | 0% (0/100) | 0% (0/17) | Ollama not used |
| `merlin-providers/src` | 0% (0/125) | 0% (0/33) | External APIs mocked |
| `merlin-routing/src/cache` | 0% (0/98) | 0% (0/16) | Not critical for e2e |
| `merlin-routing/src/metrics` | 0% (0/12) | 0% (0/3) | Not critical for e2e |

### Low Coverage - ACTIONABLE GAPS (<30%)

Critical modules that need more fixture coverage:

| Module | Lines | Functions | Priority | Gap Analysis |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **merlin-agent/src/executor** | 5.44% (18/331) | 2.27% (3/132) | üî¥ HIGH | Task decomposition, parallel execution, scheduler |
| **merlin-agent/src/validator** | 10.39% (16/154) | 7.5% (3/40) | üî¥ HIGH | Validation pipeline, citation checks, syntax validation |
| **merlin-context/src/embedding/vector_search** | 26.84% (179/667) | 24.24% (24/99) | üü° MEDIUM | Search logic, query processing |
| **merlin-context/src/embedding/chunking** | Unknown | Unknown | üü¢ IMPROVED | Was 0%, now 68.57% (config.rs) |
| **merlin-context/src/embedding/vector_search/scoring** | 0% (0/421) | 0% (0/42) | üü° MEDIUM | Relevance scoring, RRF fusion, BM25 |

## Gap Analysis

### Why Scoring Still at 0%

**Chunking Fixed** (0% ‚Üí 68.57%): Embedding generation now runs synchronously during fixture setup.

**Scoring Still 0%**: Scoring happens during semantic search queries, not embedding generation.

**Code Path**: `ContextBuilder::build()` ‚Üí `vector_manager.search()` ‚Üí `score_results()`

**Missing**: Fixtures that make context requests triggering semantic search with actual query matching.

### Why Executor Still at 5.44%

**Scheduler/Decomposition Not Triggered**: Fixtures return simple TypeScript string responses, not TaskList.

**Code Path**: `ExecutorPool` ‚Üí `schedule_steps()` ‚Üí parallel execution ‚Üí conflict detection

**Missing**: Fixtures with LLM responses returning TaskList with:
- Multiple sequential steps
- Parallel steps (no dependencies)
- Exit requirements (file_exists, file_contains, pattern matching)
- Retry logic (soft/hard errors)
- Nested decomposition (TaskList returning TaskList)

### Why Validator Still at 10.39%

**Validation Stages Not Triggered**: Fixtures use mock responses that succeed; validation never fails.

**Code Path**: `ValidationPipeline` ‚Üí `run_stages()` ‚Üí citation/syntax/build validators

**Missing**: Fixtures that:
- Return code with missing file references (citation validator)
- Return code with syntax errors (syntax validator)
- Trigger multi-stage validation cascade
- Test early exit on critical failures

## Coverage by Component Category

| Category | Average Coverage | Assessment |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **User-Facing** (TUI, rendering, input) | 65-75% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Tools & Runtime** (file ops, bash, TS) | 70-85% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Agent Execution** (executor, validation) | 35-45% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |
| **Context/Embedding** (chunking, search) | 40-50% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed (chunking fixed, scoring gap) |
| **Context/Scoring** (semantic search) | 0-10% | ‚ùå Major gap |
| **Routing/Providers** (mocked) | 0-7% | ‚úÖ Intentional |
| **Test Infrastructure** | 55-65% | ‚úÖ Good |

## Realistic Coverage Goals

### Current State
- **Fixture coverage:** 46.46% lines, 16.05% functions
- **Untestable code:** ~12-17% (mocked routing, CLI, OS errors)
- **Actionable gaps:** ~10-15% (executor, validation, scoring)

### Short-Term Goal (50-55%)
**Target Additions:**
- TaskList decomposition fixtures (+300-400 lines executor coverage)
- Validation failure fixtures (+100-150 lines validator coverage)
- **Expected Total:** 50-52% lines

### Medium-Term Goal (55-60%)
**Target Additions:**
- Semantic search query fixtures (+300-400 lines scoring coverage)
- Context builder fixtures (+100-150 lines context coverage)
- **Expected Total:** 55-58% lines

### Long-Term Maximum (60-65%)
**Realistic Ceiling:**
- 12-17% of code is untestable by fixtures (mocked/CLI/OS-level/platform-specific)
- ~800-1000 lines routing/providers/metrics (intentionally mocked)
- ~200-300 lines CLI entry points (fixtures bypass CLI)
- ~300-500 lines OS-level error paths
- ~100-200 lines platform-specific code

**Note:** >65% coverage unrealistic given architectural constraints.

## What NOT to Cover with Fixtures

‚ùå **Skip these (not reachable by fixtures):**
- CLI entry points (`cli.rs`, `handlers.rs`)
- Production constructors needing real API keys
- OS-level error paths (permission denied, disk full)
- Platform-specific branches (Windows vs Unix)
- Routing internals (intentionally mocked)
- External provider implementations (intentionally mocked)
- Metrics/cache internals (not critical for e2e)

## What TO Cover with Fixtures

‚úÖ **Focus on:**
- Agent executor task decomposition (TaskList responses)
- Validation pipeline stages (failures, warnings, errors)
- Context selection and semantic search (queries)
- User-facing thread operations
- Error display in TUI
- Task tree interactions
- File operation workflows
- Multi-turn conversations

## Key Findings

1. **Fixtures Exercise Real Paths**: 46.46% fixture coverage >> 27.34% all-tests coverage
2. **User-Facing Code Well-Tested**: TUI rendering/runtime 76-87%, application logic 61-63%
3. **Intentional Mocking Effective**: Routing/providers 0-7% by design (tested separately)
4. **Major Gaps Identified**: Executor (5.44%), validator (10.39%), scoring (0%)
5. **Chunking Fixed**: Was 0%, now 68.57% after embedding generation improvement
6. **Scoring Needs Queries**: Embeddings generated but no semantic search triggered
7. **Executor Needs TaskLists**: No decomposition fixtures exist yet
8. **Validator Needs Failures**: All fixtures succeed, no validation triggered

## Recent Improvements

**2025-10-31**: Embedding generation in fixture setup
- **Change**: Modified test runner to generate embeddings synchronously during setup
- **Impact**: +4.23pp coverage (42.23% ‚Üí 46.46%), +685 lines
- **Modules Fixed**: Chunking 0% ‚Üí 68.57%

## Conclusion

**46.46% fixture coverage is excellent** given:
1. ‚úÖ 12-17% of code intentionally untestable by fixtures
2. ‚úÖ User-facing code has 65-85% coverage
3. ‚úÖ Fixtures focus on real behavior, not mocked internals

**Key gaps are fixable:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent task decomposition (5.44%) - needs TaskList fixtures
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation pipeline (10.39%) - needs failure fixtures
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Semantic search scoring (0%) - needs query fixtures

**Next target:** 50-55% coverage with TaskList and validation fixtures.
