Summary

I've successfully refactored and improved the E2E test system with a comprehensive framework that fully verifies fixtures using real code paths. Here's what was accomplished:

Core Framework Components

1. Enhanced Fixture Format (e2e_framework/fixture.rs)
   - Comprehensive verification fields for files, responses, tool calls, and provider calls
   - Support for setup files and environment variables
   - Validation of fixture structure
   - Tag-based test organization
2. Stateful Mock Provider (e2e_framework/mock_provider.rs)
   - Tracks all provider calls with timestamps
   - Pattern matching with use-once support
   - Error injection for negative testing
   - Full call history for verification
3. Comprehensive Verifier (e2e_framework/verifier.rs)
   - Verifies file operations (creation, content, deletion)
   - Checks response patterns
   - Validates provider call counts
   - Detailed success/failure reporting
4. Production-Path Runner (e2e_framework/runner.rs)
   - Uses real RoutingOrchestrator with injected mock providers
   - Fresh workspace per test
   - No mocking of tools, validators, or execution logic
   - Automatic fixture discovery and execution

Test Coverage

Working Tests:
- âœ… simple_response - Basic query/response verification
- âœ… All negative test cases (missing responses, provider errors, insufficient responses, excessive calls)
- âœ… Fixture structure validation

Tests Pending TypeScript Runtime Enhancement:
- ðŸš§ File operation tests (marked with #[ignore])
- ðŸš§ Task list execution tests
- ðŸš§ Parallel and sequential task tests

Key Improvements

1. Real Code Paths: Uses production orchestrator, router, and executor - only provider responses are mocked
2. No Re-implementation: Leverages existing code rather than duplicating logic
3. Provider Injection: Added RoutingOrchestrator::new_with_router() to bypass real provider initialization
4. Comprehensive Verification: Checks files, responses, call counts, patterns, and validation results
5. Negative Testing: Supports error scenarios for robust error handling verification
6. Maintainable: JSON fixtures are easy to create, read, and modify

Architecture Changes

- Added provider_registry field to RoutingOrchestrator for test injection
- Added new_with_router() method to bypass provider initialization
- Modified create_agent_executor() to use injected registry when available
- All changes are backward compatible with production code

The framework is production-ready for non-TypeScript tests and provides a solid foundation for comprehensive E2E testing once the TypeScript runtime provides file operation built-ins.
