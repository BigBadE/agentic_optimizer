# Fixture Coverage Report

**Overall Fixture Coverage: 25.57% lines (4105/16052), 8.66% functions (513/5926)**

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 05:04

This document tracks which files are covered by the fixture-based integration tests. The fixture system tests end-to-end user interactions by simulating complete CLI sessions.

**ðŸ“Š See [COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md](COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed analysis of why coverage is low and how to fix it.**

## Key Findings

- **Self-determination system (0% coverage)**: Never tested via fixtures. Needs assessment response fixtures.
- **CLI entry points (0% coverage)**: Fixtures bypass CLI layer by creating TuiApp directly.
- **Conversation history (0% coverage)**: No multi-turn fixtures exist.
- **Orchestrator (48.7%)**: Only streaming execution path tested, not batch/analysis paths.

### SHOULDN'T COVER:
These are not user-facing and should remain in SHOULDN'T COVER:

**Test-only files:**
- Test helpers, mock implementations, test utilities

**Third-party integrations not yet used:**
- Language server backends (not connected)
- Local model providers (optional feature)
